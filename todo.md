- [ ] the client needs to stop sending websocket messages when the server dies, loses connection after a few seconds
- [ ] there is something wrong with PlayerSprites when rendering for other players, it needs to do a NEW IMAGE LOAD every time,
      move the image loading into its own class, so the sprites can reference the loaded blobs.
